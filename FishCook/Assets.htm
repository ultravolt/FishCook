        <p><span class="c2">Summary: In Fish Cook, everyone is a
        chef who specializes in fish.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Each day, players will buy fish at the
        fish market, and other ingredients at the farmer's market.
        Then they will create delicious dishes using old family
        recipes, and new ones they learn at the cooking
        school.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Earn the most money, and you will be
        declared the Master Chef!</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Players: 2-6</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Playing Time: 45 min.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Included in the Game:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Fish Market Board (2
        sections)</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Farmer's Market Board (2
        sections)</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">36 Recipe Cards</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">102 Ingredient Tokens in 6
        types</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">One Leader Token (Chef)</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Five Day Markers (Cats)</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">You Also Need:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Money in denominations of $1, $5, and
        $20 / $25, enough for about $250 per player.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Twelve 6-sided dice.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">Note: If you have at least one more
        6-sided die, it will be easier to set up the Fish Market
        and the Farmer's Market at the same time.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">At our house, we have a special die for
        each row in the Farmer's Market, so we can roll all the
        dice at the same time.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Setting Up:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Give each player $100. Put the rest of
        the money in the bank.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Shuffle the recipe cards and deal two
        cards to each player, face down. These represent each
        player's "family recipes." You never just draw more cards,
        but you can buy cards, as described later.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Place the Fish Market and Farmer's
        Market in the middle of the table, with space for the
        Cooking School between them, as shown below. The Cooking
        School is just empty table space containing four face-up
        recipe cards, the deck of recipe cards, and the day
        markers.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Set out day markers (the tokens with
        cats) based on the number of players:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">The player who has</span> <span class=
        "c4">most recently cooked will take the chef token and the
        first turn. It's up to your group to decide what qualifies
        as "cooking." Putting milk on cereal probably doesn't
        count.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">If you play another game with the same
        group, the winner of the previous game will go
        first.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">On Each Day:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">A "day" consists of two parts: Morning
        and Evening. In the Morning, players can buy goods from the
        Farmer's Market, fish from the Fish Market, and cards from
        the Cooking School. In the evening, players will
        cook.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Preparing for the Morning:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">At the start of each day, refill the
        Fish Market, Farmer's Market, and Cooking School, as
        follows:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">The Farmer's Market: Roll a die for
        each row in the Farmer's Market.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Each row in the market has small dice
        icons in some of the spaces, showing how to fill the row.
        Fill each row from left to right, up to the designated
        spot.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">For example, in the row below (the
        Roe/Ginger row), if you roll a 2 or a 3, you fill the row
        to the third spot, because that spot is marked with a 2 and
        a 3.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">If the row is already filled to that
        level or higher, then you will leave it as it is. You never
        have to remove anything when setting up the Farmer's
        Market.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">The Fish Market: Roll the 12 Fish dice,
        and sort them into the appropriate spaces in the Fish
        Market. Fill each row from right to left</span><span class=
        "c3">. (This is backwards from the Farmer's Market, because
        both markets have the more expensive spaces towards the
        middle of the layout.)</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Each row can only hold five fish. If
        you roll more than five fish of the same value, re-roll the
        extras.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">The Cooking School: The School is
        between the Market boards. It contains four face-up recipe
        cards, and the deck. Each day, add new cards until there
        are four, leaving any cards from the previous
        day.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Playing the Morning:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">In the morning, the players can buy all
        the things they need for cooking.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Starting with the leader (the player
        holding the chef token), and proceeding clockwise, players
        take turns buying one item at a time.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">With each buy, a player may do one of
        the following:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Buy a Fish. Take a fish from the Fish
        Market, and pay (to the bank) the price marked on that
        space.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Buy an Ingredient: Take an item from
        the Farmer's Market, and pay the price marked on that
        space.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Buy a Recipe: Buy a card from the
        School and put it in your hand.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">The price for a face-up recipe is
        $5.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">You may also buy the top card of the
        deck (keeping it face down) for $2.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Pass. Buy nothing. Passing does not
        take you out of play, but if everyone passes in turn, the
        morning will end.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Ending the Morning: The morning ends
        when any single row in the Farmer's Market is</span>
        <span class="c4">empty. For example, if someone buys the
        last Sake, this will empty that row of the Farmer's Market,
        and cause the morning to end.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">When the last item in a row is bought,
        it's customary to ring a bell (not included). Every player
        then gets one more buy, including the player who bought
        that item.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">When the bell is rung, pass the Chef to
        the next player (the player after whoever bought the last
        ingredient). This could move the Chef to anyone, even the
        player who currently has it.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">The player holding the Chef will cook
        first in the evening, and will also go first on the next
        day.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Other Ways to End the Morning: The
        morning also ends if the Fish Market is</span> <span class=
        "c4">com</span><span class="c4">pletely empty (with the
        same Chef passing rules as above), or if all players pass
        in sequence. In the latter case, the chef marker goes to
        the next player in sequence, after the last player who
        passes. (This hardly ever happens.)</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Playing the Evening:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">In the evening, players take turns
        making</span> <span class="c4">recipes. Players will make
        one recipe at a time, taking turns as they did in the
        morning, until all the fish are gone.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Basic Rules of Cooking: To make a
        recipe, you must spend all the ingredients shown on the
        card (one of each), as well as a fish of the appropriate
        value.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">The ingredients must match exactly, but
        the fish can be any size of the required value or higher.
        Thus, for example, if your recipe calls for a size-4 fish,
        you can actually make it with a 4, 5, or 6.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Playing a higher value of fish does not
        change the dollar value of the recipe, but it does give you
        some flexibility with larger fish.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">Note: Pay attention when you buy fish,
        because sometimes bigger fish are cheaper, and therefore
        strictly better, than smaller ones!</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Each recipe has two cash values: a
        larger main value, and a smaller bonus value. When you cook
        a recipe, you always earn the larger number, but the bonus
        is awarded differently depending on who owns the
        recipe.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Details of Cooking:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">You can make any recipe you can see,
        anywhere on the table. It can be in your hand, in the
        school, or in anybody's menu. Here are the
        details:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Make a Recipe from Your
        Hand:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Collect the money indicated on the
        card, including the bonus. The card is placed face up on
        the table in front of you, as part of your "menu."
        (</span><span class="c4">Your menu represents the signature
        dishes for which your restaurant is known.)</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Make a Recipe from the
        School:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Collect the money indicated on the
        card, but</span> <span class="c4">not the bonus. Add the
        recipe to your menu, as described above.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">Note: You do not have to pay for these
        recipes, as you would in the morning. You're basically
        "stealing" it from the School.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Make a Recipe from Your Own
        Menu:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">This earns you the money again,
        including the bonus.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Make a Recipe from Another Player's
        Menu:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Collect the money for the recipe. The
        recipe's current owner gets the bonus.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Now you have a chance to steal the
        recipe, as follows:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Roll a die. If you roll equal to or
        higher than the bonus value of the recipe, steal it. Move
        the recipe card into your menu.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">An example: if the recipe has a bonus
        value of 4, you must roll a 4 or higher to steal
        it.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Passing: In the evening, you must pass
        if you can't cook anything.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">If you pass while you still have fish,
        you must throw one fish away.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Ending the Day: The day ends when all
        players' fish are either cooked or discarded.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">At the end of the day, remove one day
        marker from the cooking school. If today was the last day,
        the game is over.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Otherwise, refill the Markets and the
        School, and play another day.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">Market ingredients will keep from day
        to day, but all fish spoil. They must always be either
        cooked or discarded.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c2">Ending the Game: At the end of the
        game, players will collect a "menu bonus" as
        follows:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">For each rank of fish (size 1, size 2,
        etc), award a menu bonus to the player who has the most
        recipes of that rank.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">The bonus is the same as the rank of
        fish: $1 for the size-1 recipes, $2- for the 2's, and so
        on.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">If there is a tie for most recipes, all
        the tied players receive the full bonus.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c3">After the bonuses are awarded, count up
        your money. The player with the most money wins!</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Designer's Notes (James Ernest,
        2013)</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">The current version of this game is set
        in a strange crossover universe between France and Japan.
        The dishes are clearly Japanese dishes, but thematic
        elements are also left over from the original French
        design.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">There is an odd abstraction in Fish
        Cook that dates back to the original game, in which a
        "day"</span> <span class="c4">seems to have both the
        concrete length of one day (fish go bad at the end of each
        day) and a more abstract length of "part of one's career,"
        which could represent a number of months or even years. We
        believe this is a charming artifact of the
        origi</span><span class="c4">nal design and have made no
        attempt to fix it.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">It is delightful to see how much game
        design has evolved in the last 104 years.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c5">Other False Historical
        Notes:</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">Copies of the original game</span>
        <span class="c5">Claude Hubert</span> <span class="c5">la
        Cri&Atilde;&copy;e are difficult to find.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">The game was originally released in
        France in 1909 as the first in Jacques de Flandres'
        "Jeux</span> <span class="c4">Cuisines" series. All the
        games in the series were based on the same basic mechanics,
        with Fish Cook being the original and most popular.
        Some</span> <span class="c4">images from the game appear in
        catalogs of the time, and a very small number of intact
        copies survive in the hands of private
        collectors.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">Throughout the 60's, 70's and 80's
        there was a revival of the fish cooking game genre,
        including Owen Pordland's</span> <span class=
        "c5">Fishcraft</span><span class="c4">, and Works and
        Sundry's game</span> <span class="c5">Beyond the
        Sea</span><span class="c4">, both of which owed a clear
        debt to de Flandres. There was also a humorous cooking game
        called</span> <span class="c5">Bring your Fish</span>
        <span class="c5">to Work Day</span><span class="c4">,
        published in the October 1997 issue of</span> <span class=
        "c5">Parody Title Magazine</span><span class=
        "c4">.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">There is some controversy over the
        intellectual rights in this edition, specifically whether
        the</span> <span class="c4">Japanese publisher,
        Shimizu-Leifan Holding Company (SLHC), who released</span>
        <span class="c5">Yum Yum Super</span> <span class="c5">Fish
        Delicious in 1994, had a clear right to the game mechanics.
        It appears that no French patent or trademark existed on
        the original game, and so in theory Shimizu-Leifan was
        within their rights to copy it with no legal obligations to
        the heirs of Jacques de Flandres, the game having fallen
        out of copyright.</span></p>

        <p><span class="c4">Hoping to rise above such petty issues
        as copy</span><span class="c4">right and trademark law,
        Cheapass Games is proud to release this English translation
        of</span> <span class="c5">Yum</span> <span class="c5">Yum
        Super Fish Delicious under license from SLHC. We hope that
        our cavalier attitude with regard to the true pedigree of
        this game will serve as an homage to de Flandres' original
        high concept of stealing fish recipes without giving due
        credit.</span></p>
